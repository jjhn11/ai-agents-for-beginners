      "- Start: 09:00\n",
      "- End: ~21:00\n",
      "- Transport: mostly walking + Metro. Buy a day pass (Paris Visite zones 1–3) or individual t+ tickets.\n",
      "- Book ahead: Louvre timed-entry, Eiffel Tower ticket (day/time and level), and consider a Seine cruise reservation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed timeline\n",
      "- 08:30–09:15 — Breakfast near the Louvre\n",
      "  - Café or boulangerie for coffee, croissant / pain au chocolat.\n",
      "  - Location idea: Rue de Rivoli or Palais-Royal area.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 09:15–11:15 — Louvre Museum\n",
      "  - Prebook a timed-entry ticket to avoid long queues.\n",
      "  - Focus suggestions: Denon wing (Mona Lisa, Winged Victory, Egyptian collection) — pick 1–2 wings to avoid museum fatigue.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 11:30–12:30 — Walk along the Seine to Musée d’Orsay & short visit\n",
      "  - 20–30 minute riverside walk (beautiful views and bookstalls).\n",
      "  - Musée d’Orsay highlights: Impressionists (Monet, Renoir, Van Gogh).\n",
      "  - If you prefer a longer museum visit, swap the afternoon schedule.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 12:45–13:45 — Lunch in Saint-Germain-des-Prés\n",
      "  - Brasserie/street-bistro options; try steak frites, croque-monsieur, or a seasonal salad.\n",
      "  - Nice cafés on Boulevard Saint-Germain or Rue de Buci.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 14:15–16:00 — Eiffel Tower visit\n",
      "  - Travel by Metro/RER to Champ de Mars / Trocadéro for best photo views.\n",
      "  - Prebook elevator access (2nd floor or summit). Expect security lines even with a ticket.\n",
      "  - If you prefer, get picnic supplies and enjoy the Champ de Mars lawns instead of going up.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 16:15–17:15 — Seine river cruise (Bateaux Parisiens or similar)\n",
      "  - Cruises depart near the Eiffel Tower; a 1-hour cruise gives a refreshing perspective on bridges and monuments.\n",
      "\n",
      "- 17:30–18:15 — Trocadéro & sunset photos\n",

      "  - Le Marais: trendy bistros, falafel, wine bars.\n",

      "  - Consider finishing with a stroll through Île de la Cité to see Notre-Dame exterior and evening lights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Practical tips\n",
      "- Book tickets in advance: Louvre, Eiffel Tower summit, and popular Seine cruises often sell out.\n",
      "- Transport: single t+ ticket covers metro/buses for short trips; a day pass (Paris Visite) is convenient if you’ll ride many times.\n",
      "- Luggage: if arriving by train/airport with luggage, use left-luggage services (Gare du Nord/Gare de Lyon) or lockers.\n",
      "- Safety: watch for pickpockets in tourist areas and on crowded metros.\n",
      "- Dress: comfortable walking shoes, a light waterproof jacket if rain likely; evening dining can be smart-casual.\n",
      "- Weather: check day-of forecast; Paris can change quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Estimated costs (per person, approximate)\n",
      "- Louvre entry: €15–20\n",
      "- Musée d’Orsay entry: €14–16\n",
      "- Eiffel Tower (2nd floor): €12–18; summit: €25–35\n",
      "- Seine cruise: €12–20\n",
      "- Meals: breakfast €4–10, lunch €12–25, dinner €20–50\n",
      "- Transport day pass: €7–14 (depending on type) or €2.10 per single ticket\n",
      "\n",
      "Accessibility & family notes\n",
      "- Louvre, Musée d’Orsay, and many boats are accessible but check elevator availability in advance.\n",
      "- Kids: consider reducing museum time and adding Luxembourg Gardens (playground) or Cité des Enfants (if visiting La Villette).\n",
      "\n",
      "Want me to:\n",
      "- Book a timed Louvre/Eiffel slot for you (I’ll need the date and number of people)?\n",
      "- Make a shorter/longer or theme-specific plan (food, art, family)?\n",
